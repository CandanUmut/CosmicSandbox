# Cosmic Sandbox ðŸŒŒ

Welcome to the **Cosmic Sandbox**â€”a universe simulation project blending **quantum mechanics**, **AI-driven entities**, and **philosophical exploration**.

## Features
- **Quantum-Infused Decision Making**: Entities decide based on a combination of neural networks, confidence aggregation, and quantum-inspired randomness.
- **Dynamic Entity Ecosystem**: Thousands of entities interact, evolve, and explore in real-time.
- **Customizable Modules**: Expand the simulation with new features like terrain, DNA, and entanglement.
